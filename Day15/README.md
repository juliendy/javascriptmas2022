# ↔️ Palindromes

## The challange:
Palindromes are words that are the same forward or backward. For example, 
the words "noon" and "kayak" are a palindromes.
 
Write a function to check if a lowercased string of letters is a palindrome. 
If the word is palidrome, return true. If it isn't, return false. 

This version of the code is using my own, to suit it for a one page application where
the user can input a word and it is check if it is a palindrome. Two see the two versions,
check the root repository readme for links.
