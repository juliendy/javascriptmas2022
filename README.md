# JavaScriptmas2022 🎄
24 days of JavaScript challenges from Scrimba

## What is JavaScriptmas? 🎁
This is a chance for developers to level up their JavaScript skills with daily coding challenges from December 1st to 24th. This year there may be around 3000 participants, all hoping to have their code chosen for a grand prize. Participants can also review other people’s code for a second chance to win.
